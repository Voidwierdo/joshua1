        <p>This course has been rough, a lot of ups and downs 
        as we move from nothing to becoming web developers
        . The journey through HTML and CSS has had interest
        ing and boring aspects. Free code camp was the very
        first tuitor used for this course. Even though free
        code camp has it's benefits, there are a lot of flaws
        that have to be checked. Free code camp doesn't treat
        it's users like beginners, but rather like amateurs making 
        it difficult learn if you have no experience</p>
